Things this code will do:

--Take out all references to Verdana and replace with Helvetica; make all text easier to read with increased size and fewer instances of bolded font

--Where you see display:none, that’s mostly where we’re hiding all references to comments and overriding the circa 2002 gradient look of which LibGuides is so fond. Gradients can be gorgeous, but use them wisely, everyone.

--The colors in this custom code are blue and grey — be sure to color-match to your library site. For easier color-matching, refer to screenshots and find/replace these hex codes:
#012d6b is navy blue (border of buttons)
#3c5e8e is medium blue (buttons and box titles)
#00a7e5 is bright blue (active and hover buttons)
#eaeaea is light grey (band where search bar is)
#ffffff is white (button and box title text)

--Make the tabs at the top of the page into buttons with rounded corners (flat color). Guides with multiple tabs may find that by default the tabs stack up on top of each other unattractively; buttons make slightly more sense and look better.
